# Educational Technology Plan

My educational technology plan is to prepare, plan, and implement the new AP Computer Science Principles course at Gladstone High School in Covina.

## Context

My educational technology plan is to prepare, plan, and implement the new AP Computer Science Principles course at Gladstone High School in Covina.

### Course

AP Computer Science Principles

“AP Computer Science Principles is an introductory college-level computing course that introduces students to the breadth of the field of computer science. Students learn to design and evaluate solutions and to apply computer science to solve problems through the development of algorithms and programs. They incorporate abstraction into programs and use data to discover new knowledge. Students also explain how computing innovations and computing systems—including the internet—work, explore their potential impacts, and contribute to a computing culture that is collaborative and ethical.”  - College Board 

Prior computer science experience is not required to take this course.

This course will meet the “g” of the A-G requirement.

Prerequisite:  Junior/Senior standing and a grade of “C” or better in Integrated II

### Situation

Gladstone High School is one of two comprehensive high schools in the Azusa Unified School District.  Located in the northwest corner of the city of Covina, GHS is part of the east San Gabriel Valley in Los Angeles County and is approximately twenty-five miles from downtown Los Angeles.  AUSD encompasses 9.7 square miles of Azusa and parts of Covina and unincorporated Los Angeles County, however, the majority (87%) of the students reside in Azusa.  

The school serves a multicultural population, predominantly Latino (92.8%), living in a variety of neighborhoods whose family economic status ranges from lower middle to poverty levels. GHS has been designated as a Title I school since 2016, with 74.4% of students on free or reduced-price lunch.

The ethnic distribution of the students is 92.8% Hispanic, 2.8% White, 1.2% African American, and 3.2% other ethnicities. 

The student enrollment of the students is English Learner population is 14.8%, socioeconomically disadvantaged 83.3%, students with disabilities 16.8%, foster youth 0.9%, and homeless 5.9%.


In March 2019 AUSD invested in providing all students a Chromebook to use for distance learning.  As students returned to the classroom, they were given the option to keep the Chromebook for home use.  Most students chose to keep the Chromebook to complete homework for the upcoming school year.


Most teachers were given classroom sets of new laptops at the start of the year and wireless access points were installed in each classroom.  However, the district’s wi-fi does not provide consistent connection to sites.  They have recently hired a new director of technology.

The district provides tech support for staff and students.  In addition, if a student’s Chromebook stops working, they can exchange it for a working Chromebook at the school site.  

During distance learning teachers and students became more proficient at using technology to implement Google Suite application.  Like many students throughout the nation, there was students who had limited or no internet access at home.  The district eventually provided hotspots for families who requested them.  Many students still choose to complete assignments on their phone due to faster connection times.

One of GHS’s WASC goals is commit resources to increase student use of technology.  In previous years progress was made towards meeting this goal by providing teachers with chrome carts.  Another stop to meeting this goal was to create a Graphic Arts Academy that begins with IT Principles, Design, and then coding and other computer science skills.  A new Apple computer lab was purchased to support this academy to its fullest capacity.

One constraint is the boards recent decision to close our high school and convert it to a middle school.  This Tech Educational Plan will be used for next year, however my school will only be open for two more years.  For this reason, I am going to try to make my plan flexible and broad.  I may be teaching this course at another site in a few years.

Class size is maxed out at 36 in my district; however, AP classes are typically smaller.  Initially, recruiting students for the course may be a challenge and therefore the class size may be small.

Although there is an Apple computer lab on campus that was purchased to support the new academy, I believe I will need to plan on implementing the course using student Chromebooks due to possible scheduling conflicts.  However, if I am allowed to use the lab, I would be more than happy to.

## Plan

### Software Specifications

Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.

### Hardware Specifications

Describe the hardware requirements for your class. Provide specific requirements
wherever necessary.

### Application

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.
