# Educational Technology Plan

My educational technology plan is to prepare, plan, and implement the new AP Computer Science Principles course at Gladstone High School in Covina.

## Context

My educational technology plan is to prepare, plan, and implement the new AP Computer Science Principles course at Gladstone High School in Covina.

### Course

AP Computer Science Principles

“AP Computer Science Principles is an introductory college-level computing course that introduces students to the breadth of the field of computer science. Students learn to design and evaluate solutions and to apply computer science to solve problems through the development of algorithms and programs. They incorporate abstraction into programs and use data to discover new knowledge. Students also explain how computing innovations and computing systems—including the internet—work, explore their potential impacts, and contribute to a computing culture that is collaborative and ethical.”  - College Board 

or (couldn’t decide)

“This course introduces students to the foundational concepts of computer science and explores the impact computing and technology have on our society.

With a unique focus on creative problem solving and real-world applications, the AP Computer Science Principles course gives students the opportunity to explore several important topics of computing using their own ideas and creativity, use the power of computing to create artifacts of personal value, and develop an interest in computer science that will foster further endeavors in the field.”  - CodeHS Syllabus

Prior computer science experience is not required to take this course.

This course will meet the “g” of the A-G requirement.

Prerequisite:  Junior/Senior standing and a grade of “C” or better in Integrated II

### Situation

Gladstone High School is one of two comprehensive high schools in the Azusa Unified School District.  Located in the northwest corner of the city of Covina, GHS is part of the east San Gabriel Valley in Los Angeles County and is approximately twenty-five miles from downtown Los Angeles.  AUSD encompasses 9.7 square miles of Azusa and parts of Covina and unincorporated Los Angeles County, however, the majority (87%) of the students reside in Azusa.  

The school serves a multicultural population, predominantly Latino (92.8%), living in a variety of neighborhoods whose family economic status ranges from lower middle to poverty levels. GHS has been designated as a Title I school since 2016, with 74.4% of students on free or reduced-price lunch.

The ethnic distribution of the students is 92.8% Hispanic, 2.8% White, 1.2% African American, and 3.2% other ethnicities. 

The student enrollment of the students is English Learner population is 14.8%, socioeconomically disadvantaged 83.3%, students with disabilities 16.8%, foster youth 0.9%, and homeless 5.9%.


In March 2019 AUSD invested in providing all students a Chromebook to use for distance learning.  As students returned to the classroom, they were given the option to keep the Chromebook for home use.  Most students chose to keep the Chromebook to complete homework for the upcoming school year.


Most teachers were given classroom sets of new laptops at the start of the year and wireless access points were installed in each classroom.  However, the district’s wi-fi does not provide consistent connection to sites.  They have recently hired a new director of technology.

The district provides tech support for staff and students.  In addition, if a student’s Chromebook stops working, they can exchange it for a working Chromebook at the school site.  

During distance learning teachers and students became more proficient at using technology to implement Google Suite application.  Like many students throughout the nation, there was students who had limited or no internet access at home.  The district eventually provided hotspots for families who requested them.  Many students still choose to complete assignments on their phone due to faster connection times.

One of GHS’s WASC goals is commit resources to increase student use of technology.  In previous years progress was made towards meeting this goal by providing teachers with chrome carts.  Another stop to meeting this goal was to create a Graphic Arts Academy that begins with IT Principles, Design, and then coding and other computer science skills.  A new Apple computer lab was purchased to support this academy to its fullest capacity.

One constraint is the boards recent decision to close our high school and convert it to a middle school.  This Tech Educational Plan will be used for next year, however my school will only be open for two more years.  For this reason, I am going to try to make my plan flexible and broad.  I may be teaching this course at another site in a few years.

Class size is maxed out at 36 in my district; however, AP classes are typically smaller.  Initially, recruiting students for the course may be a challenge and therefore the class size may be small.

Although there is an Apple computer lab on campus that was purchased to support the new academy, I believe I will need to plan on implementing the course using student Chromebooks due to possible scheduling conflicts.  However, if I am allowed to use the lab, I would be more than happy to.

## Plan

### Software Specifications

All software requires a secure and reliable internet connection:

CodeHS.com (Teacher and Students)
CodeHS is recognized by the College Board and is an endorsed provider of curriculum and professional development for AP CSP.  This will afford my school access to the pre-approved syllabus and professional development.  Code HS will serve as main platform for the course.  I would request my district purchase the CodeHS Pro upgrade to provide all the tools, resources and support needed to run a high quality computer science program.  The AP Computer Science Principles course includes:

Lesson Plans
Videos & Slides
Exercises
Projects
Comprehensive Assessments
Examples
Formative Assessments
Cheat Detection Tools
Gradebook
Progress Monitoring

In addition, students will access the online IDE to write, run & debug code in a web-based IDE on CodeHS.  

Google Workspace for Education Fundamentals with Teaching and Learning Upgrade
(Teacher and Students)
Students will use Google Apps such as Gmail, Classroom, Docs, Slides, Forms, and Drive to collaborate and communicate throughout the course.  

Google Classroom LMS (Teacher and Students)
Our school uses Google Classroom so it would be necessary to include agenda’s, syllabi, and course announcements on this site.  It is integrated with Google Apps, Aeries, and CodeHS.

Aeries SIS (Teacher and Students)
The SIS platform is used  for district gradebooks, attendance, student contact information, and parent communication.  The platform provides mobile Apps, analytics, parent reports, and cloud backs of teacher gradebooks.  Students and parents access Aeries to check their students progress at their convenience.  

Slack (Teacher and Students)
A communication tool for students and teacher to collaborate to be more productive.

GitHub Education (Teacher and Students)
I would like to incorporate GitHub for my course projects.  Students would then be able to collaborate with others and build a portfolio to showcase real-world experience in the future.  

Hapara (Teacher and Students)
Hapara helps teachers monitor students working in real-time and encourages digital citizenship.  It provides ethical Chromebook monitoring with Hapara Highlights which encourages students to stay on task and take ownership of their learning.  Teachers can monitor their students open tabs during instructional hours, see students current screens, guide browsers, and send private messages to students who are off task.

Microsoft Office 365, GoodNotes, Acrobat Pro DC (Teacher Only)
Used for daily lesson planning and note taking guides.

Loom for Education (Teacher Only)
The video recording and editing platform can be downloaded as a desktop app or as a Chrome extension.  Lessons can be up to 45 minutes have many advanced features that are free for educators.  They can also be integrated into Google Classroom.

### Hardware Specifications

### Application

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.
